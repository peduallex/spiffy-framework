## Installation

Spiffy\Framework can be installed using composer which will setup any autoloading for you.

`composer require spiffy/spiffy-framework`

Additionally, you can download or clone the repository and setup your own autoloading.

## Documentation

> Dammit man, I'm a programmer, not an English major!

The individual components (see above) are mostly documented but the core framework has not yet been documented. I'll be making this a priority when I have the time.

## Credits

* Actions were primarily inspired by [@pmjones](http://twitter.com/pmjones) and [his ADR: A Tentative MVC Refinement](http://paul-m-jones.com/archives/5970) post.
* The core application architecture is heavily inspired by [ZF2's MVC layer](https://github.com/zendframework/zf2/tree/master/library/Zend/Mvc).
