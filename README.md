* Actions were primarily inspired by [@pmjones](http://twitter.com/pmjones) and [his ADR: A Tentative MVC Refinement](http://paul-m-jones.com/archives/5970) post.
* The core application architecture is heavily inspired by [ZF2's MVC layer](https://github.com/zendframework/zf2/tree/master/library/Zend/Mvc).
